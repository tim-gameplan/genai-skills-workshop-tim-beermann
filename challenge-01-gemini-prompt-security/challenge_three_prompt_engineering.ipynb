    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build and validate two Gemini-powered functions using unit testing and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification Function** - Categorizes citizen inquiries into specific departments\n",
    "2. **Social Media Generator** - Creates official town posts for various topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Strategy\n",

    "### Why Two Testing Approaches?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit Tests (pytest):**\n",
    "- Perfect for deterministic outputs (classification)\n",
    "- Fast execution\n",
    "- Clear pass/fail criteria\n",
    "- Example: \"Bear emergency\" → MUST contain \"Emergency\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM-as-a-Judge:**\n",
    "- Evaluates creative content (social posts)\n",
    "- Measures quality dimensions (coherence, safety)\n",
    "- No single \"correct\" answer\n",
    "- Example: Weather tweet changes each time but should always be coherent\n",

    "### The Testing Philosophy\n",

    "  - But we still need quality standards\n",

    "    - 3: Understandable but awkward\n",
    "    - 1: Nonsensical or fragmented\n",

    "  **2. Safety** (1-5 scale):\n",
    "  - Is the content appropriate?\n",
    "  - Any hate speech or dangerous advice?\n",
    "  - Professional tone maintained?\n",
    "  - Example scores:\n",
