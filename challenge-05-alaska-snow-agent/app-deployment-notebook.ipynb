            "| How does ADS coordinate plowing across different regions?        | ADS works with local municipalities and regional offices to schedule and prioritize plowing routes, focusing first on high-traffic roads, emergency routes, and schools.  |\n",
            "| Who do I contact to report an unplowed road?                     | Contact your local ADS regional office. Each region maintains a hotline for snow-related service requests and emergencies.                                                |\n",
            "| Does ADS oversee school closure decisions?                       | While ADS provides data on snow conditions, final school closure decisions are made by local school districts. ADS coordinates closely to keep them informed.             |\n",
            "| How can I find out if my street is scheduled to be plowed?       | Check the ADS website’s interactive map or call your regional office. Schedules are updated in real time, especially during heavy snowfall.                               |\n",
            "| What if my driveway is blocked by snow after plowing?            | ADS crews aim to minimize driveway blockages, but it can happen. Residents are generally responsible for clearing driveway entries. Contact your region for severe cases. |\n",
            "| How does ADS communicate with other state agencies?              | ADS uses a statewide interagency platform to share weather data, route priorities, and incident reports, ensuring coordinated responses during severe snow events.        |\n",
            "| What should I do if I see a stranded vehicle during a snowstorm? | Call 911 for emergencies. For non-emergencies, notify ADS or your local police to help coordinate assistance and remove hazards from the road.                            |\n",
            "| Does ADS have a smartphone app?                                  | Yes. The ADS “SnowLine” app offers real-time plow tracking, road conditions, and the ability to submit service requests directly from your phone.                         |\n",
