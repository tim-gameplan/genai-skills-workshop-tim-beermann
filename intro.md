Google Cloud Self-Paced Labs

Overview
This Cloud Skills Boost lab creates a Google Cloud project and account that let you complete Challenge Labs and Case Studies for the Google Public Sector Skills Assessments. The environment runs for two days, after which the project and all its resources will be deleted.

If you want to keep your work, be sure to save it outside this temporary project—e.g., on your local machine, in a cloud project you own, or in a GitHub repository—so you can access it after deletion.

Target Audience
This lab is intended for students participating in the Google Public Sector Skills Assessment Bootcamps.

Setup and Requirements
Qwiklabs setup
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

What you need
To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Time to complete the lab.
Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab.

Note: If you are using a Pixelbook, open an Incognito window to run this lab.

Cloud Console
How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud Console
Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.

Open Google Console

Copy the username, and then click Open Google Console. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.

Sign in

Tip: Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

If you see the Choose an account page, click Use Another Account.
Choose an account
In the Sign in page, paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.

Important: You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Qwiklabs credentials. If you have your own Google Cloud account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).

Click through the subsequent pages:

Accept the terms and conditions.
Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
Do not sign up for free trials.
After a few moments, the Cloud Console opens in this tab.

Note: You can view the menu with a list of Google Cloud Products and Services by clicking the Navigation menu at the top-left. Cloud Console Menu
