    "# Challenge Three: Prompt Engineering with Automated Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build and validate two Gemini-powered functions using unit testing and comprehensive LLM evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification Function** - Categorizes citizen inquiries into specific departments\n",
    "2. **Social Media Generator** - Creates official town posts for various topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two-Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge uses **two different models** working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MODEL 1: Gemini 2.5 Flash (Generator)\n",
    "    Role: Generate responses to user queries\n",
    "    Used by: classify_inquiry(), generate_social_post()\n",
    "    Cost: ~$0.075 per 1M input tokens\n",
    "    \n",
    "         ↓ [generates output]\n",
    "         \n",
    "MODEL 2: Vertex AI Evaluation Judge (Evaluator)\n",
    "    Role: Score the quality of Model 1's outputs\n",
    "    Used by: EvalTask with model-based metrics\n",
    "    Model: Likely Gemini Pro or specialized judge model\n",
    "    Cost: Included in evaluation service\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Unit Tests (pytest)\n",
    "- **Best for:** Deterministic outputs with exact answers\n",
    "- **Use case:** Classification (must return specific category)\n",
    "- **Speed:** Fast, Cost:** Free\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LLM Evaluation (Computed + Model-Based Metrics)\n",
    "- **Best for:** Creative outputs with variable results\n",
    "- **Use case:** Social media posts (different each time)\n",
    "- **Metrics:**\n",
    "  - **Computed metrics:** Reference-based, deterministic (BLEU, ROUGE)\n",
    "  - **Model-based metrics:** Semantic evaluation by judge LLM (coherence, safety, fluency)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prompt Comparison (Requirement #5)\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Compare different prompt strategies scientifically\n",
    "- **Method:** Evaluate multiple prompt variants on same task\n",
    "- **Output:** Data-driven recommendation for best prompt"
